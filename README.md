- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

DawnTransition is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'DawnTransition'
```
Run pod install to integrate it into your project.

#### ðŸ“¦ Swift Package Manager

DawnTransition also supports [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager):

#### In Xcode:
- File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency
- Add `https://github.com/snail-z/DawnTransition.git`
- Select "Up to Next Major" with "1.1.0"

#### Or manually in Package.swift:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/snail-z/DawnTransition.git", from: "1.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YOUR_TARGET_NAME",
            dependencies: ["DawnTransition"]
        )
    ]
)
```
Then run swift build to fetch and integrate the package.

```swift
let pan = DawnPanGestureRecognizer(driver: self, type: .dismiss) { [weak self] in
    guard let `self` = self else { return }
    self.dismiss(animated: true)
}
pan.isRecognizeWhenEdges = false
pan.recognizeDirection = .leftToRight
view.dawn.addPanGestureRecognizer(pan)
```
